A JavaFX based software for visualizing telemetry data comming from a serial port.
Basically you define with a json file how your telemetry coming from the serial port looks and how the commands look that you want to send. Then you can use the GUI to easily visualize the telemetry and send commands via serial port.

## Keyfeatures
* tested on Linux and Windows
* supports visualization of GPS data in google maps
* terminal style output available
* charts with ediable bounds or auto ranging
* send predefined commands via serial port 
* CRC16 support

But since this software was specifically developed for Daedalus-Project (launching an experiment with a rocket), it is somewhat under construction. But if you are interested in anything (how to use it, bugs, features) create a github issue.
